set wildmenu

" NOW WE CAN:

" THING TO CONSIDER::
" - :b or :buffer lets you autocomplete any open buffer

" TAG JUMPING:

"Create the 'tags' fil (may need to install ctags first)
command! MakeTags !ctags -R .

"NOW WE CAN:

" -user ^t to jump back up the tag stack

"THING TO CONSIDER:
" - This doesn't help if you want a visual list o tags

" AUTOCOMPLETE:

" ctrl + n

"HIGHTLIGHTS:
" - ^x^n for JUST this file 
" - ^x^f for filenames

" NOW WE CAN:
" - use ^n and ^p to go back and forth in the suggestion list

let g:netrw_list_hide=netrw_gitignore#Hide()
let g:netrw_list_hide.='\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+)'
